# Collection of Graph Converters
Tools to convert (large) graphs between different file formats.

## edgelist2metis
Converts an edge list (in text format) generated by KaGen to the Metis graph format. 
The edge list can be stored in a single file `filename`, or split across multiple files `filename_0`, ..., `filename_n` 
(each file must contain the header line). 
Each file must be small enough to fit into memory.
In both cases, call `edgelist2metis filename` to convert the graph. 

## metis2binary
Converts a graph in Metis graph format to the binary graph format used by KaHiP. 
The metis graph must be stored in a single file `filename`, which is converted by calling `metis2binary filename`. 
The file **does not** have to fit into memory.
